# Terrace node

## Functionality
The terrace node is very similar to the bedroom node. With two main differences:
* It monitors light amount.
* It does not have clap-detection support.

No further documentation of this node is needed.

The node supports OTA software updates, under the URL "http://terrace_node.local"
